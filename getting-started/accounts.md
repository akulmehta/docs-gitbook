# Accounts

## What is an account?

An account is what holds all your information. This is the core concept of Monica. An account contains vaults, which contain contacts.

## How do we create an account?

To use Monica, you need an account. To create an account, a few information are required:

* the full name
* a valid email address
* a password.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Why do we require a valid email address?** We do not spam. Your email address is not used for any marketing purposes whatsoever. We have never done it, and never will. In fact we don't care about marketing.

That being said, we still need to make sure that you are not a bot, and that we will be able to send you reminders that will arrive in your inbox safely. That's as simple as that.
{% endhint %}

The full name is necessary since we will create a contact entry that represents you in the system.

When you create an account, you will be asked to create your first vault, and we'll create your first contact inside this vault. The name that you use on the signup form will be used to create this first contact.

You can have as many users as needed in an account. We have a [dedicated documentation about managing users](../user-and-account-settings/manage-users.md) in an account.

## Accounts are populated with default options

Your account will come pre-loaded with a bunch of default settings that let you be up and running in seconds.

For instance, genders are already defined, as well as pronouns, relationship types, and a lot of other options.

These default settings are what most people would want to have in a tool like Monica.

**You are not stuck with these defaults**. We believe that documenting someone's life is deeply personal, and this is why we have gone great lengths to let you customize everything in Monica. You will be able to customize everything in your account.

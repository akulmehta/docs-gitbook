# Welcome to Monica

Monica is an open-source personal CRM. It lets you document your life and your contacts. We've been doing this project since 2017 as a side project, and it has grown beyond our expectations.

It is accessible from [https://app.monicahq.com](https://app.monicahq.com).

### Personal CRM?

A CRM is a Customer Relationship Management software. It is used in the sales world to keep track of who you've spoken to, who's ready to buy your stuff and follow up during the entire customer lifecycle. A CRM however, is not suited for documenting your contacts or your life, although the intention is similar. A personal CRM is a set of tools that let you mimic this behaviour and document your personal contacts, but not in a business context.

### **Open source?**

**Open-source** means that the code is free, and freely available for everyone to read or change. The code [is available on Github](https://github.com/monicahq/chandler).

It also means that Monica can be host by anyone **for free**, on your server or wherever you want. We provide an official Docker image for the software that you can use, and we also have a bunch of other non official installation methods. The only thing that you can't do is try to make money out of it. Apart from that, there is no limitations.&#x20;

In fact, even this documentation is open source and [hosted on Github](https://github.com/monicahq/docs-gitbook). If you see something that seems wrong, or inaccurate, you can update its content yourself and request a change.

### Side project

Monica is born out of our passion to work on tools that improve people's lives. We, the authors ([Regis](https://twitter.com/maazarin) and [Alexis](https://twitter.com/asbin)) as well as the hundred of contributors around the world, work most of the evenings and weekends on this project.

We want to provide a tool that everyone can benefit from. When we hear your stories about how Monica helped you in your life, nothing makes us happier.

We also want to have a tool that people love and find it cool. We are not a typical project. We don't really care about revenues, or marketing. We care about our users and whether the project is useful, cool and fun to work on. While some founders look at how much dollars they've raised, we look at the number of stars we have on our [Github repository](https://github.com/monicahq/chandler).

One of the main advantages of Monica being a side project is the increased creativity and freedom it provides. Since side projects are not constrained by the same commercial pressures as a traditional business project, we are free to explore new ideas and take risks that they might not otherwise be able to. It also offers greater autonomy and control over the project direction and outcome. We don't have to answer to anyone but our users (and us).

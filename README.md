# Prologue

Monica is an open-source personal CRM. It lets you document your life and your contacts. We've been doing this project since 2017 as a side project, and it has grown beyond our expectations, despite being a side project still.

#### Personal CRM?

A CRM is a Customer Relationship Management software. It is used in the sales world to keep track of who you've spoken to, who's ready to buy your stuff and follow up during the entire customer lifecycle. A CRM however, is not suited for documenting your contacts or your life, although the intention is similar. A personal CRM is a set of tools that let you mimic this behaviour and document your personal contacts, but not in a business context.

#### **Open source?**

**Open-source** means that the code is free, and freely available for everyone to read or change.

It also means that Monica can be host by anyone for free. We provide an official Docker image for the software that you can use, and we also have a bunch of other non official installation methods. The only thing that you can't do is try to make money out of it. Apart from that, there is no limitations.&#x20;

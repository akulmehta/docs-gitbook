# ðŸ“° Journals

## Introduction

Monica, as stated in our [introduction page](<../README (1).md>), is about documenting your life. It lets you document your contacts, but it should also let you document what you do with your life. Journals let you do that.

A journal is a personal diary. You can document anything you want with it. Journals are deeply personal. To reflect that, we've created a structure that let you format your journal the way you want. Would you like to document your life as single entries every day? Would you like to have a travel journal with a structure like Day 1 - you've done this, Day 2 - you've done that...? Would you like to have a predefined content for each entry? With Monica, everything is possible and you are only limited by your imagination.

### Differences with other diary apps

We believe Monica is in a unique position to offer something drastically different from any other diary applications out there. Monica is a tool to document your life, including your contacts. We offer some great tool to let you write down what you do with your contacts.

Now imagine an application where you can mix your contact's data with a journal. Every post you write can be linked to a contact. Every activity you do can be linked to a journal entry.

With Monica, you can have an extremely tight integration with all your contacts. No other apps can do that.

### Structure

To understand all the possibilities of the journal in Monica, you have to understand its structure, as it's a tiny bit complex.

A journal has **posts**. A **post** is the core of your journal, obviously.

A post has a **template**.

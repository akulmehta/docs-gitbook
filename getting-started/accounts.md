# Accounts

## What is an account?

In Monica, an account serves as the central repository for all your information. This includes vaults, which in turn house your contacts. Simply put, an account is the foundation upon which Monica is built, allowing you to organize and access your data with ease.

## How do we create an account?

To use Monica, you need an account. To create an account, a few information are required:

* the full name
* a valid email address
* a password.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Why do we require a valid email address?** We do not spam. Your email address is not used for any marketing purposes whatsoever. We have never done it, and never will.

That being said, we still need to make sure that you are not a bot, and that we will be able to send you reminders that will arrive in your inbox safely. That's as simple as that.
{% endhint %}

The full name is necessary since we will create a contact entry that represents you in the system.

When you create an account, you will be asked to create your first vault, and we'll create your first contact inside this vault. The name that you use on the signup form will be used to create this first contact.

You can have as many users as needed in an account. We have a [dedicated documentation about managing users](../user-and-account-settings/manage-users.md) if you need more information on that part.

## Accounts are populated with default options

Upon creating an account, you can quickly get started with Monica thanks to its pre-loaded default settings. This means you can be up and running in a matter of seconds, without the need for extensive setup or configuration.

For instance, genders are already defined, as well as pronouns, relationship types, and a lot of other options.

These default settings are what most people would want to have in a tool like Monica.

**You are not stuck with these defaults**. At Monica, we understand that documenting one’s life is a highly personal endeavor. That’s why we’ve gone to great lengths to ensure that you have complete control over every aspect of your account. With Monica, you have the ability to customize every detail to your liking, allowing you to create a truly personalized experience.

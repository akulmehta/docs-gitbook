# Introduction

We’ve learned over the years that people want to customize their Monica experience. It’s deeply personal, and everyone’s needs are different. That’s why we take pride in allowing every part of Monica to be tailored to each individual.

Yes, that makes building the product more complicated, but the benefits for the users are immense. Monica is a true personal CRM, and we don't dictate how the product should be used.

This is where the Settings page on Monica truly shines - you will be able to customize almost everything in the product.

Settings are divided into two categories:

* User settings
* Account settings

{% hint style="info" %}
**User settings** apply only to the logged in user.

**Account settings** apply to everyone on the account.
{% endhint %}

User settings can only be changed by the logged in user. Account settings can only be changed by users with account administration permissions.

# Introduction

Vaults are the central pieces of Monica. They contain your private data–contacts, documents, photos. You can't store something in Monica if not in a vault.

Vaults are private by nature.

Inside the same account, users who are not part of a vault cannot see the contents of a vault, even if they are administrators of the account.

Creating a vault is the first step every new user of Monica should do–as otherwise, there is nothing else to do in the account.

There are no limits on the number of vaults in an account. The typical use case, though, is to have one vault per user in the account, and possibly a shared vault as well.

### A note about vault visibility and permissions

A vault can have one or more users. Those users must be in the same account.

If you are not part of the vault, you can’t access it – and you can’t even see the vault on your dashboard.

Let's be clear: **even if you are the account administrator, you won’t be able to access a vault if you are not part of that vault**. And you won’t see the vault on your dashboard.

This makes vaults super flexible. For instance, if you are part a family, you can have your own vault with your work contacts, your spouse can have their own vault and you can have a shared vault with data that needs to be shared.

## Creating a vault

To create a vault, you must head to the `/home` page, and click on the Create vault button.

A vault needs a name. Try to keep the name as descriptive as possible.

You can also specify a description if you like, but it's not mandatory. The vault's description will be seen in the vault's list.

### A note about the user

When you create a vault, Monica will automatically create a contact inside this vault and associate it with you, the user.

This contact will represent you. You can't delete this contact yourself, but an administrator of the vault will be able to delete it.

Why do we add yourself in the account?

* to be able to link contacts to you, through relationships,
* to let you have your own dashboard in the vault.

## Deleting a vault

When you delete a vault, you will delete all the items that were in the vault, forever. There is currently no way to retrieve the data once a vault is deleted.

Deleting a vault is also instantaneous. Make sure you know what you are doing.

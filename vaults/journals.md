# ðŸ“° Journals

## Introduction

Monica, as stated in our [introduction page](<../README (1).md>), is about documenting your life. It lets you document your contacts, but it should also let you document what you do with your life. Journals let you do that.

A journal is a personal diary. You can document anything you want with it. Journals are deeply personal. To reflect that, we've created a structure that let you format your journal the way you want. Would you like to document your life as single entries every day? Would you like to have a travel journal with a structure like Day 1 - you've done this, Day 2 - you've done that...? Would you like to have a predefined content for each entry? With Monica, everything is possible and you are only limited by your imagination.

## Differences with other journaling apps

We believe Monica is in a unique position to offer something drastically different from any other journaling app out there.

[A vault](broken-reference) can have as many journals as needed.&#x20;

# Introduction

In Monica, we've learned after years and years of working on it that people want to be able to fully customize their experience. Monica is deeply personal, and what I want to manage is different from what you might want to manage, as we have completely different lives and point of views. This is why we take great pride in allowing every single part of Monica to be customizable to everyone's needs.

Yes, that makes building the product more complicated, but the benefits for the users are immense. Monica is a true personal CRM, and we don't dictate how the product should be used.

This is where the Settings page on Monica truly shines - you will be able to customize almost everything in the product.

Settings are divided into two categories:

* User settings,
* Account settings.

{% hint style="info" %}
**User settings** apply only to the logged user.&#x20;

**Account settings** apply to everyone on the account.
{% endhint %}

User settings can only be changed by the logged user. Account settings can only be changed by users with the right permissions.

# Meet Monica

## Key concepts

Monica strives to document people’s lives. Your life is composed of events that occur to you and interactions with those close to you, both personally and professionally. By recording what happens to you and to others, we believe we can significantly enhance your life.

At its core, Monica has a few key concepts:

* [accounts](getting-started/accounts.md)
* [vaults](broken-reference)
* contacts

When users register for Monica, they create an account. This account is the foundation for managing all their data. The person who creates the account is the first administrator. If desired, additional administrators can be added later. Other users can also be added to the account, but they won’t have the same privileges as administrators, which prevents them from making unwanted changes.

Vaults host users’ data, such as contacts and documents. An account can have multiple vaults. Vaults are private within an account, so other users in the account, even if they are administrators, cannot read the data in a vault unless they are part of that vault. They cannot even see that the vault exists.

A contact is the core data of Monica. It's someone you know (or think you know). A contact lives inside a vault. Monica lets you document everything about this contact, including their social graph: children, family, and so on.

The idea is for you to create contact sheets for each of the people you want to document in your life. Every piece of information you want to remember about the contact can then be added to the contact entry in Monica.

## Principles <a href="#core-philosophy-of-the-product" id="core-philosophy-of-the-product"></a>

Your life is one-of-a-kind. Nobody else in the entire universe has the same life and values as you. That’s why we created Monica based on these values:

* We do not discriminate based on race, color, religion, gender, national origin (ancestry), disability, marital status or sexual orientation. Everything we do at Monica is in support of this commitment. We do not judge.
* Customizable: We believe every piece of information in Monica should be tailored to your preferences. Whenever possible, we let you personalize your experience based on your lifestyle.
* Monica is simple and powerful. It’s easy to use for everyone, even those without technical skills. And if you need more power, we provide tools to customize it to your needs.
* Monica is and always will be open source. Everyone can read the source code and contribute to make the software better. However, not all contributions will be accepted. We care deeply about the experience we offer our community and may reject contributions that don’t align with our vision. If you’re unsure, please ask us before submitting.
* Private: Monica is for you alone. Your data is yours. We don’t display ads and never will. We have never sold your data and never will. We have never done so and never will.

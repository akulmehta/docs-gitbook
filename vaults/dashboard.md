# Customizing a vault

## Introduction

Monicaâ€™s vaults offer a wide range of features, and you may find that some are more relevant to your needs than others. Fortunately, you have complete control over which features you use, and can choose to show or hide them as desired. This allows you to tailor your experience to your specific needs and preferences, ensuring that you can work efficiently and effectively within the vault.

There are also some settings that are unique to a vault, while other settings are account-wide.

**Why are not all settings account-wide?**

Some settings should affect everything in an account, while some settings should only have an effect on a specific vault.&#x20;

## Vault settings

### Manage vault users



There are several pieces of data that you should keep an eye on:

1. Contacts that were last updated.
2. Reminders in the next 30 days.
3. Open tasks.

## Last updated contacts

This widget contains the last 5 contacts that were updated by any users in the vault. Updating means any information that was added, edited or removed in the contact entry.

There is no way to define the number of contacts that are shown here.

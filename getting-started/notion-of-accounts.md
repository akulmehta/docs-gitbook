# Notion of accounts

## What is an account?

An account is what holds all your information. This is the core concept of Monica. An account contains vaults, which contain contacts.

## How do we create an account?

To use Monica, you need an account. To create an account, a few information are required:

* the full name
* a valid email address
* a password.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Why do we require a valid email address?** We do not spam. Your email addres is not used for any marketing purposes whatsoever. We have never done it, and never will. In fact we don't care about marketing.

That being said, we still need to make sure that you are not a bot, and that we will be able to send you reminders. That's as simple as that.
{% endhint %}

When you create an account, you will be asked to create your first vault, and we'll create your first contact inside this vault. The name that you use on the signup form will be used to create this first contact.

You can have as many users as needed in an account. We have a [dedicated documentation about managing users](../user-and-account-settings/manage-users.md) in an account.

# Introduction

Vaults are the central pieces of Monica. They contain your private data–contacts, documents, photos, journal entries, and so on. You can't store something in Monica if not in a vault.

Vaults are private by nature.

Inside the same account, users who not part of a vault can't see the content of a vault, even if they are administrators of the account.

Creating a vault is the first step every new user of Monica should do–as otherwise, there is nothing else to do in the account.

There are no limits on the number of vaults in an account. The typical use case, though, is to have one vault per user in the account, and possibly a shared vault as well.

### A note about vault visibility and permissions

A vault can have one or more users. Those users must be in the same account.

If you are not part of the vault, you can’t access it – and you can’t even see the vault on your dashboard.

Let's be clear: **even if you are the account administrator, you won’t be able to access a vault if you are not part of that vault**. And you won’t see the vault on your dashboard as well.

This makes vaults super flexible. For instance, if you are part a family, you can have your own vault with your work contacts, your spouse can have her own vault and you can have a shared vault with data that need to be shared.
